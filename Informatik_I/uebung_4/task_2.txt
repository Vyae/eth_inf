Task 2:

a)
	f -> [0;31]: f(x) = 2^x

b)	The output of the this code snippet should be correct for inputs between 0 and 31

c)	Case 1: n = 0
		x is set to 1 and the if statement is false, as n = 0 and not n > 0.
		x is correctly printed and the program exits.

	Case 2: n = 1
		The first if statement is true, so the do-while-loop is executed.
		The second if statement is also true, which means, that the loop is exited.
		Therefore x contains after one loop execution the correct value 2, which is printed.

	Case 3: n = 31
		The first statement is true, so the do-while-loop is executed.
		The second if statement is true, after the 30th cycle of the loop, which means the
		loop is about to be exited.
		But as the multiplication by two is performed after the if statement, it is executed 
		31 times. After that the loop exits and x holds the correct value 2^31 which is smaller
		than (2^32)-1 and therefore fits into an unsigned integer. x is correctly printed and 
		the program exits.
