Task 4b:

For a fast aproximation of pi sum2 is the better choice, as it converges faster than sum1.
Sum1, on the other hand, converges more accurately with increasing values for n.
Sum2 is problematic for higher values of n, as it gets more and more difficult to store the values for numerator and denominator.

For the most purposes sum2 will be accurate enough, but with sum1 and more time a higher accuracy can be achieved.
