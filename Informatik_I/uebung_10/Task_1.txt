Task_1:

	a) function: bool f(const int n):

	    i) PRE: A const integer greater or equal zero.  
	       POST: Returns true if the given integer is uneven and false if the the given integer is eve or zero.

	   ii) As the provided integer is greater or equal zero, decrementing will result in setting it to zero after a number of iterations. And if the integer is zero, the function breaks.

	  iii) call_f(n) = n+1


	b) function: void g(const int n):

	    i) PRE: A constant integer grater or equal zero. 
	       POST: Prints 2^n times a star.
	
	   ii) Again, as the provided integer is greater or equal zero, decrementing will result in setting it to zero after a number of iterations. And reaching zero, or in higher levels reaching the end of the function will terminate it.

	  iii) calls_g(n) = 2^(n+1) - 1
